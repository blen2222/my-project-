# Lesson 1: Introduction to Solidity

## Ì∑† What is Solidity?
Solidity is a high-level, contract-oriented programming language used for writing smart contracts on Ethereum and other EVM-compatible blockchains.

## Ì¥ß Key Features
- Statically typed
- Inspired by JavaScript, C++, and Python
- Compiled into bytecode for the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)

## Ìª†Ô∏è What is a Smart Contract?
A smart contract is a self-executing piece of code that runs on the blockchain and follows the rules defined by the developer. It eliminates the need for intermediaries.

## Ì≥ö Keywords Introduced
- `contract`: Used to define a smart contract
- `function`: Defines a function inside a contract
- `public`, `private`: Access modifiers for functions and variables

## ‚úÖ Summary
Solidity enables developers to build decentralized applications (dApps) that are secure, verifiable, and trustless. This lesson introduces the basic building blocks you'll use in every contract.
