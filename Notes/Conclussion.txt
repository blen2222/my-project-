Solidity is a high-level, statically typed programming language designed specifically for writing smart contracts on Ethereum and other EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine)-compatible blockchains.

Key Characteristics of Solidity:
1. Purpose-Built for Smart Contracts
Used to create self-executing programs that run on the Ethereum blockchain.

Commonly used in decentralized applications (dApps), tokens (ERC20, ERC721), DAOs, and DeFi protocols.

2. Syntax Similar to JavaScript and C++
Familiar to developers from traditional languages.

Includes common structures like if, for, while, functions, and structs.

3. Statically Typed
Variable types must be declared (uint, bool, string, etc.).

Helps catch errors during compilation.

4. Compiled to Bytecode
Solidity code is compiled into EVM bytecode, which is executed by the Ethereum Virtual Machine.

5. Deterministic and Immutable
Smart contracts behave exactly as programmed—no central control or alteration after deployment.

All changes require transactions and incur gas costs.

 Example Smart Contract in Solidity

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract HelloWorld {
    string public message;

    constructor(string memory _msg) {
        message = _msg;
    }

    function updateMessage(string memory _newMsg) public {
        message = _newMsg;
    }
}
This contract:

Stores a public message,

Lets anyone update it by calling updateMessage.

 Why Learn Solidity?
It’s the main language for Ethereum dApp development.

Powers DeFi, NFTs, DAOs, and more.

In-demand skill for blockchain and Web3 development.
